This repository builds a Geant4 geometry of CTRAP in order to simulate the efficiency and coverage for the future Silicon and scintillating detectors.

All the code for the geometry can be found in src/B1DetectorConstruction.cc

for building the code follow these steps (with UNIX based systems):

1) create a build directory next to the source directory (not inside the source directory) called NewDetectorGeometry-build

2) cd to NewDetectorGeometry-build

3) run "cmake ../NewDetectorGeometry"

4) run "make -j"


You must have the Qt and OPENGL installed in Geant4 to visualise the geometry.
